# Heart-attack-detecting-system
#Abstract
In India, close to regarding 2 hundredths of the whole population loses their lives because of an interrupted health observance system I.e., in most of the hospitals, doctor visits rarely. What happens if patient health becomes critical between that interval or if the doctor was unavailable to treat the patient? A patient might lose his/her life. So the main theme of our heart attack detection system using DE10 Nano FPGA, machine learning, and API Twilio is an innovative approach to monitor heart health and provide timely alerts to individuals who may be experiencing a heart attack.The system uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze real-time data from the DE10 Nano FPGA, which is capable of monitoring various vital signs such as heart rate, glucose levels, cholesterol levels, and ST-T wave abnormality. The system can then detect any abnormal patterns and send an alert through Twilio (API) to the userâ€™s phone, allowing them to seek immediate medical attention.This technology has the potential to save lives by providing early detection and intervention in cases of heart attack, making it an important advancement in the field of healthcare by intimating the level of the disease (i.e., initial stage, intermediate...) In this way, we can reduce the mortality rate of a heart attack patients.
